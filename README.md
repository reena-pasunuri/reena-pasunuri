Hello! I’m Reena Pasunuri, an ISTQB Certified Senior Test Engineer with over five years of experience in ensuring software quality across a variety of platforms and domains. I’ve worked extensively in manual and automation testing for web, mobile, and API applications, with a strong understanding of the entire software development and testing lifecycle (SDLC, STLC). My background includes collaborating closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders to deliver reliable software that meets user needs.

In addition to my professional experience, I recently completed an MSc in Computer Science in the UK. This academic journey allowed me to challenge myself to achieve new goals, broaden my perspective, and gain exposure to a diverse range of technologies. It helped me grow both personally and professionally, instilling adaptability, critical thinking, and resilience—qualities I now bring to every project and challenge in the realm of software engineering and testing. I’m passionate about staying current with industry trends, and I enjoy learning and experimenting with new testing tools and frameworks.

Why I Created This Project

I’ve created this project to demonstrate my hands-on expertise and to showcase my approach to building comprehensive, reliable, and maintainable test automation frameworks. Each project is domain-specific and demonstrates my hands-on experience with different automation tools and programming languages. 

In this repository, you’ll find:
