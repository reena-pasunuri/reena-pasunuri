Hello! I'm Reena Pasunuri

I'm an ISTQB Certified Test Engineer ensuring software quality across various platforms and domains. My expertise spans manual and automation testing for web, mobile, and API applications, with a strong understanding of the entire software development and testing lifecycle (SDLC, STLC). I collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders to deliver reliable, high-quality software that meets user needs.

My Journey

I recently completed an MSc in Computer Science in the UK, which helped me expand my technical expertise and adaptability. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and resilience, which I apply to every project in software testing.

Why I Created This Project

This repository showcases my hands-on expertise in building robust, maintainable test automation frameworks. Each project is domain-specific and demonstrates my experience with various automation tools and programming languages.
