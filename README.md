Hello! I’m Reena Pasunuri, an ISTQB Certified Software Test Engineer with over five years of experience in ensuring software quality across a variety of platforms and domains. I’ve worked extensively in manual testing for both web and mobile applications, with a strong understanding of the entire software development and testing lifecycle (SDLC, STLC). My background includes collaborating closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders to deliver reliable software that meets user needs.

In addition to my professional experience, I recently completed an MSc in Computer Science in the UK. This academic journey allowed me to challenge myself to achieve new goals, broaden my perspective, and gain exposure to a diverse range of technologies. It helped me grow both personally and professionally, instilling adaptability, critical thinking, and resilience—qualities I now bring to every project and challenge in the realm of software engineering and testing. I’m passionate about staying current with industry trends, and I enjoy learning and experimenting with new testing tools and frameworks.

Why I Created This Project

I’ve created this project to demonstrate my hands-on expertise and to showcase my approach to building comprehensive, reliable, and maintainable test automation frameworks. In this repository, you’ll find examples of:

Automation Testing with Selenium and Appium: Illustrating how I structure, execute, and maintain cross-platform test suites for both web and mobile applications.

Integration of Cypress, JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber: Highlighting my experience with various frameworks and test runners, and how I apply them to achieve robust test coverage and readability.

Database, Cloud, and CI/CD Integration: Demonstrating how I connect test suites to databases (SQL), utilize cloud environments (AWS) for scalable testing, and set up pipelines to automate and streamline the testing process.

By sharing this project, I hope to not only validate my technical proficiency but also help others understand best practices in test automation. It’s a living portfolio that reflects my continuous learning, adaptability, and commitment to quality in software development. 

Simply put, I’m here to build better software, learn a thing or two along the way, and add just a splash of fun to the process.
